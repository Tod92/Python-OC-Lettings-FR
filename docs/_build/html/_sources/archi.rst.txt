App and Sql architecture
========================
This app powered by Django framework run with Sqlite3, a lightweight, self-contained, file-oriented SQL database engine.
Django manage this database linking it to it's models (Python Classes).

Django's app architecture
-------------------------
- Project : oc-lettings-site
    - app : lettings
    - app : profiles

Project level ``oc-lettings-site`` :
    - Settings for all the application
    - Urls for site's index and admin interface
    - Views to serve index and error pages (HTTP 404 & 500)
    - HTML templates used to serve those views
    - TestResponse class to check asserted http reponses with pytest

App level ``lettings`` and ``profiles`` :
    - Urls, views and templates related to those apps
    - Models to interface sql objects called by the views
    - Test Classes and fixtures to test models, urls and http responses

Request Database
----------------
- Requests examples using sqlite3 CLI :
    - ``cd /path/to/Python-OC-Lettings-FR``
    - ``sqlite3``
    - ``.open oc-lettings-site.sqlite3``
    - List tables with ``.tables``
    - Show profiles table rows ``pragma table_info(profiles_profile);``
    - Request on profiles table ``select user_id, favorite_city from profiles_profile where favorite_city like 'B%';``
    - Quit with ``.quit``
