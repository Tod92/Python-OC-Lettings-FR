CI/CD Pipeline
==============
Description
-----------
This project is pre-parametred to launch Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployement. 

Tools used for CI/CD :
    - CircleCi https://app.circleci.com : 
        CI/CD orchestrator based on Docker containers
    - Docker https://www.docker.com :
        Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.
    - DockerHub https://hub.docker.com :
        Docker Hub is the world's largest library and community for container images.
    - Heroku https://www.heroku.com :
        Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Steps are as follow :
    - git push to Github
    - CircleCi, linked to your github depositry, launch pipeline workflow
    - Build : Python app gets installed and environment variables passed in it
    - Test and Lint : pytest and flake8 are run. No futher steps will occur if any of them fail.
    - After this point, the initial git push had to occur on main branch in order to launch next steps
    - Build docker : Running web app gets build in a docker image. This image gets pushed to docker Hub
    - Deploy : Docker image gets pushed to Heroku repositry and Heroku web app gets released

Setup
-----
Prerequisites :
    - This documentation Quickstart procedure
    - GitHub account with project linked to your local git deposit 
    - CircleCi account linked with your GitHub account
    - DockerHub account with public repository named ``youraccount/oc-lettings``
    - Heroku account with a web app created

- Create New Project in CircleCI and select from GitHub ``Python-OC-Lettings-FR`` repository
- Go to Project's Settings, select Environment Variables
- Add following environment variables :
    - SECRET_KEY : your django's secret key (can be found in ``path\to\Python-OC-Lettings-FR\.env``)
    - DOCKERHUB_USERNAME : your DockerHub account username
    - DOCKERHUB_PASS : your DockerHub account password
    - HEROKU_API_KEY : your Heroku api key (can be found in Heroku Account settings)
    - HEROKU_APP_NAME : your Heroku app name
    - IMAGE_TAG : your docker image name in dockerhub ``youraccount/oc-lettings``

- ``git push`` on main branch and check CircleCi Pipeline. If all steps are passed you can check your app running on Heroku.
